# memory-game

Memory game is a webpage that challenges the player to memorize three sets of four cards in five seconds.  When the timer runs out, the cards will be hidden and the player must click to uncover the same type of card consecutively until the set of four has been correctly revealed.  The real challenge and twist we put on this game is that the player can only mess up once.  If they get a set wrong, it's an immediate game over.  The replayability comes from the players stats which constantly track and update their game play including how many wins, losses, win/loss percentage, win streak, and more.

Special thanks to everyone's computers that were destroyed in the process of making this.
Shout out to Ashlin's work for letting her focus on this project full time!
Thank you Jerome for literally doing nothing to help us at all on this project.(We seriously had zero help from Jerome.)
Praise be to Alec Taber for being inspired with the game concept and getting his inspiration from the basketball games he saw.  Without Alec, none of this would be possible.
Special thanks to Joseph.
Thank you to all the friends and family members who believed in us and supported us through this long and difficult journey.
